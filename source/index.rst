Education
^^^^^^^^^^

I studied Political Science at the University of Central Florida.  I specialized in empirical and statistical analysis.  As these are somewhat specialized skillsets in the political science department I was able dedicate my time to research projects and independent study seminar courses.


Under Graduate Research 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As an undergraduate I completed two thesis papers. 

The Evolution of the WTO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The first was a documentary analysis of the development of the World Trade Organization.  My intent of this work was to determine when nongovernmental organizations modify their regulations and procedures.  I determined that they do so only when coalitions of powerful states (or governments) force them to do so.  In other words, I concluded that international organizations are designed to serve the most powerful states within that system.  

The implications of such a system are evident. For example, The western international community spearheaded by the EU (the largest economic zone by gdp) and the United States recently limited Russian trade and financial transactions by acting uniformly to manipulate the global institutions governing commerce.  The Geo-Political responses have yet to be determined; however, businesses(especially in the energy sector) must now pivot to new sources of natural gas and potash to satisfy energy and fertilizer demand for integrated economies. The legal and policy risks associated with such a pivot must be analyzed to determine whether to reinvest in developping economies beyond the borders of NATO.  

Supreme Court Behavioral Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The second thesis paper focused on the political whims of the justices of the United States Supreme Court and the commercial consequences of their decisions.  I began my analysis by scoring judges according to their ideological preferences.  I then attempted to predict their voting behavior with a bayesian inference model that took into account previous behavior.  I then compared these results to my best guess of the outcome as determined by legal precedent.  The results concluded that a simple Bayesian model is far more accurate in determining voting behavior than a legal expert's best guess informed by precedent.

This somewhat cynical conclusion is useful to any organization dependent upon commerical regulation in the United States. According to Wickard v. Filburn, the United States government may regulate any activity that may be construed to be a form of interstate commerce including subsistence production of a commodity as it may impact the commercial price of that commodity.  Such a broad implied federal right empowers the US Government to at any time restrict commercial relations if it can be argued that the activity imparts a substantial impact to interstate commerce.   The energy sector requires the goodwill of the US Government to remain competitive.  Understanding the political and legal aparatus that influences the commercial regulations in the United States as well as abroad will serve the interests of 8rivers as it builds Allam-Fetvedt Cycle powerplants that may be impacted by changing regulatory landscapes.


Graduate Research
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I began a Master's Degree in Computational Statistics at the University of Central Florida in August of 2018. I studied primarily experimental design with SAS (Statistical Programming System) and statistical analysis with R.  

At this time, I was hired by Dr. Demet Mousseau to analyze socioeconomic conditions and human rights abuses in Anatolia. The project was later published in the journal of Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy.  

My role in the project was to integrate data to correlate factors such as government hydroelectic investment in underdeveloped areas to political and ethnic violence.  I succeeded by first building a human rights law frame work from the text of international treaties to document the violence against civilians, militaries, and extremist organizations.  Then, I build a database of social indicators published by the Turkish government to determine if regional ethnic and economic differences increase the risk of violence and uncertainty in developing economies.  The results indicated that ethnic division as determined by linguistic and religious differences from the majority population are more likely to result in greater violence, lower productivity, and elevated levels of depression within the boundaries of Turkey.  From a political point of view this indicates that such regions are in need of investment to integrate divisive areas into the state economy.  The business point of view inspires caution.  While subsidized investment does seem to reduce violence in formerly disconnected provinces, social conditions still depress overall gdp growth comparitive to better connected economies.
