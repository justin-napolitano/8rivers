This repository, 8rivers, is part of my personal portfolio of experiments, prototypes, and production tooling.

In this post I’m documenting the “why” behind [8rivers](https://github.com/justin-napolitano/8rivers) — what problems it’s trying to solve, how I approached the implementation, and how it fits into the rest of my projects.

You’ll get a mix of design decisions, tradeoffs, and a few “gotchas” I ran into along the way. Over time I’ll update this page as the repo evolves, so think of it as a living document rather than a one-off release note.

If you’re into this kind of work, you can usually find me posting updates and smaller experiments on social media (Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter/X). This repo is one slice of a much larger ecosystem of tools I’m building for data, automation, and developer experience.

Finally, if you’re reading this in a content engine (Medium, dev.to, etc.), the canonical source for the code is always the GitHub repo linked above.
